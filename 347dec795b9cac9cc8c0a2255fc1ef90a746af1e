Now I don\u0027t need root to be able to run htop with a custom config.\n\nCaveat: If the device is encrypted /sdcard cannot be loaded. htop defaults back to the default config with error upon close:\n`Can not save configuration to /sdcard/.config/htop/htoprc: No such file or directory`\n\nI don\u0027t believe there can be any security concerns if htoprc is editable by all apps with full sdcard access, but I am no security expert so not giving a CR+1",
