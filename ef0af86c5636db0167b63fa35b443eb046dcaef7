      "message": "Hey!\n\nSorry about that - there were 0 merge conflicts, and we don\u0027t (by policy) push merges by people external to the organization.\n\nSo, we usually go through and re-do all upstream merges - which is what happened here.\n\nNext time, I\u0027ll go back and re-edit the merge to maintain original author - just seemed on a 0 conflict merge, not needed.\n\nYour authorship was maintained on the commit above this, though!\n\nThanks for your contribution.",
